# Place files

In the .zip file there is a main.js file. This needs to be placed on the webserver in the right folder, where it will be used. You have to look up for the corresponding .html or .php file and place the next line in the <head>...</head> section:
<script src="main.js"></script>

Then you have to find the perfect place for the booking scheduler in your page in the <body>...</body> section and copy the following line:
<div id=""></div>

After all the above, everything is ready.
Ezek után már minden készen is áll a használatra.
